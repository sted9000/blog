Rules are under-rated.
By restricting you, they give you freedom.

I guess we have rules ranging from implicit to explicit.
And I guess some rules involve set and setting while others supersede them.
My guess is that I would be better off being more aware of my unconscious rules as well as practicing some more explicit ones.
And what is the difference between a habit and a rule? Is a rule simply a habit with a justification.

Anyway here is a list of rules I have come across:

- Stand-up straight with your shoulders back - [JBP Rule 1]()

- Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping -

- Make friends with people who want the best for you

- Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today

- Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them

- Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world

- Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient

- Tell the truth (or, at least don't lie)

- Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't

- Be precise in your speech

- Do not bother children when they are skateboarding

- Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street

- Assume your temperament will always be somewhat childish and impatient, and set your rules accordingly, knowing that you cannot abide by rules for rules sake.
