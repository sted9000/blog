Hi. This is my short form blog for 2019 where I hope to clarify my thoughts on the basics and get away from all the noise that I generally fill my attention with. Tags might include: relationships, growing-up, learning, language, communication, cool tools, and what it is like to be a person. 

This blog was inspired by [jonny spicer's blog](https://jonnyspicer.com) and [brainpickings](https://brainpickings.com).

Thanks for reading. You can find more about me and what I am up to at [tedslocum.com](https://tedslocum.com).
