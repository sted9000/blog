title: "Integrate vs Compartmentalize"
---

Both compartmentalization and integration might both be useful philosophies when balanced artfully. However, having had abundant freedom and minimal responsibility over the last 10 years, I embraced integration exclusively.

Having swung so extremely to one side of this duality I got to clearly see the costs and benefits.

It is time to trim the tree and give compartmentalization it'd due in the areas where integration has born little or no fruit.

With that said, my starting point would be this: _integrate your life, except where you shouldn't._

Further exploration upcoming...
