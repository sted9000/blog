title: "Fooling Around"
---

Today is a day of much and many emotions.
A day of looking forward and backwards, of firsts and lasts.
Smiling for all the great people who have been in my life and for those whom will always be.

Sometimes you fool around, sometimes others fool you, most often, I find, you fool yourself.
