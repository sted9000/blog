title: "I Love Rules"

I know that I have written about this before, but the thought crossed my mind again today about how useful and disrespected rules are. They are great. You don’t want to have to weigh options all the time. More and more I am finding simplicity and systems are keys for making decisions.

“When a bit tired in the afternoon and have the options of nap or coffee, choose nap.”
