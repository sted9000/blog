Three ideas from the [econtalk episode](https://www.econtalk.org/sebastian-junger-on-tribe/) with S. Junger:

>"What it seems to be is that if you give people an urgent task, it gives them the opportunity to stop thinking about themselves." - S. Junger

The idea that we are a lot more self centered today because we are less enmeshed roles that are vital for our community.

'Tribalism' is a negative word these days. But maybe it should be looked at as a part of our nature that is neither good or bad, but both.

>"And our journalists, as well. One of the things that disturbs me about journalism today is that journalists have just given up any pretense of objectivity; and indulge in that precise emotion: Contempt." - R. Roberts

A definition of contempt:  n.
The feeling or attitude of regarding someone or something as inferior, base, or worthless; scorn.

No matter how bad our opponents ideas or how self-serving their tactics, giving in to this emotion of contempt seems to be both the easy way out and the less effective route to progress.
