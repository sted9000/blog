One resolution this year is to continue to explore meditation.
The number one way I want to explore is to sit down on a more regular basis.

Setting a simple goal of sitting everyday seems right.
In the past I have pushed towards loftier goals and ended up dreading siting.
This seems like one area where pushing and efforting seems sub optimal.
Curiosity and a friendly freeroll seem like a better motivator.

The goal is to string together the rest of January.

Here is the [link]() for the freeroll on freeroll.io.

[Here] is my current streak as of 07/01/19.

[Here] is where I will post my streak after 31/01/19.

Good luck us.
